    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, fuel prices have been a frequent topic of discussion. Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, partly due to the war in Ukraine, prompting the Dutch government to intervene. This was done by introducing an excise duty reduction on gasoline, diesel, and LPG starting from April 1, 2022 [1]. As of July 1, 2023, half of this 'discount' expired, and by the end of this year, on December 31, 2024, this measure will be fully phased out [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite rising fuel prices, the total number of cars in the Netherlands has not decreased. In fact, it has continued to grow [3]. This suggests that many Dutch people still consider the car an important mode of transport, regardless of the increasing fuel costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what impact do these rising fuel prices actually have on the number of kilometers traveled, and are people adjusting their mode of transport accordingly?\n",
